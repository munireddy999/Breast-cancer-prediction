## Introduction

The breast cancer prediction project aims to build a model that can accurately classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign. This can help in early detection and treatment of breast cancer.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction and selection
- Model training using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm
- Evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the classifier
- Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal value of `k`

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/breast_cancer_prediction_K.ipynb
   ```

Alternatively, you can view and run the notebook directly on Google Colab.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`notebooks/breast_cancer_prediction_K.ipynb`) in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run all the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.
3. Modify the notebook to test different models or datasets.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled data, indicating whether a tumor is malignant or benign. The dataset can be found in the `breast cancer.csv/` directory. If you're using a different dataset, ensure it is in the correct format and update the data loading section in the notebook accordingly.

## Model

The project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify tumors as malignant or benign. The model is trained on the provided dataset and achieves high accuracy in predicting breast cancer.

## Finding the Optimal Value of k

To achieve the best accuracy and model performance, various values of `k` (the number of neighbors) were tested. The optimal value of `k` was determined based on the highest accuracy achieved during cross-validation.

## Results

The performance of the classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The KNN model used in this project achieves an accuracy of **[96.5]%**, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting breast cancer.
